# Entropy
Compiler for Entropy, a programming language where all data is in a constant state of decay. Entropy forces the programmer to give up on precise control, and get an idea across in the short time before their program falls apart. 

> **Note**
It's the language xkcd 3062 describes, written 14 years before xkcd 3062!

The compiler takes these options:

    /h or /? -- print help screen
    /m -- set mutation rate (speed that data decays), must be between 0.001 and 100
    /d -- Debug mode: parse tree and print to screen
    /c -- Transpile to C#
